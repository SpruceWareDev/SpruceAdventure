# SpruceAdventure
A small 2d game made in java with no libraries.

## Building
If you want to build the project, it's a gradle project so you can download the src code and open the build.gradle in intellij and it should automatically build and will be fully and ready to develop for yourself. Currently there are no external libs so there should be no issue building. You will need JDK 11 for the project unless you know how to build it in other versions.
